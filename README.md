# Monte Carlo: Pi
Using Python to estimate pi

## Installation
Install the mcpi.py file, and run it by navigating to its directory in a command console like CMD and run it by typing 
```bash
python3 mcpi.py
```
## Usage
When you run it, the console will prompt you with a request with the number of operations. The more you type in, the more accurate the output will be. Once entered, the program should return an estimate of pi. This uses a popular method called the [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) where you rely on random sampling to obtain certain results. In this case, the Python file is using the random library to calculate pi.
